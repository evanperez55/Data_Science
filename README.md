# Multiplying Matrices
Statistical problem solved using Python.


##  (B)Matrices Multiplication Problem

(a) Write a program that multiplies two rectangular matrices -- please no square matrices -- whose elements are randomly generated.
You will have two versions of the program, 
one in which matrix elements are integers and another one where they are real numbers (double).

Measure the time it takes each program to complete.
Since the matrices are randomly generated, you will have to run the program several times,
measure the running time and then calculate meaninful statistics related to the running time of your programs.

(b) Change your multiplication algorithm and repeat the steps above;
for instance, if you used the the naive multiplication algorith with the column in the inner loop,
then just use the same algorithm with the row in the inner loop.

Explain the differences in running time between the two versions of your multiplication algorithms.
