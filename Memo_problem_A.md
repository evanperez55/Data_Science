1) Opened datafile.din.
2)looped through each line and counted occurences of reads(0), writes(1), and instruction fetch(2) by assigning unique counts to each.
3)Establish frequency variables and calculate relative frequency for reads and writes.
4)Import variables from frequency.py into histogram.py.
5)Use variables to plot frequency on a histogram chart

Relative Frequency:

reads(0) = 0.51
writes(1) = 0.28
